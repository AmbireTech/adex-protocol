# Smart platform

@TODO take the intro and the entire flow to README.md


The state represented by the channel will contain a tree of the publisher's earnings, and they can withdraw by proving valid signatures of the state and that their balance is in the state tree. The channel is strictly unidirectional, as with each next message, the total earnings of the publishers would increase, depleting the total deposit by the advertiser.

This design is partially inspired by [AdMarket](https://github.com/adchain/admarket). However, unlike AdMarket, the payment channel is based on our [OUTPACE design](/OUTPACE.md) - which means it can have any number of validators, and 2/3 supermajority of signed messages would advance the state.
However, in the real world, this design can be used with 2 validators only (demand and supply) while still keeping the system trustless. The events (including impressions) are sent to both. If the event is, for some reason, received by one side only (e.g. network issues), the sides have to come to an agreement whether to record it or not. If the advertiser (demand) decides to underreport, or the publisher (supply) decides to overreport, the other side can always stop advancing the channel and withdraw their funds.

### @TODO furthermore, admarket uses normal payment channels while OUTPACE is one-to-many

The entire flow is:

1. The advertiser (demand) starts a [campaign](#campaign) with a total budget and certain parameters (ad units, targeting, min/max price per impression/click/etc.); this translates to opening an [OUTPACE channel](#outpace); at this point the advertiser delegates two validators: one that represents them (advertiser-side [platform](#validator-stack-platform)), and one that represents publishers (publisher-side [platform](#validator-stack-platform))
2. Publishers will query the network for available demand every time someone opens their website/app; the query will happen on the client side (in the browser/app), much like regular header bidding; the [AdEx SDK](#sdk) will select one of those bids and relay that selection to the validators
3. The user will generate events (impressions, clicks, page closed, etc.) and send them to the validators
4. The events will be reflected by the validators, creating a new state; each valid impression event is turned into a micropayment to a publisher; publishers will be immediately able to use that state to withdraw their earnings
5. Should the publisher decide to withdraw their earnings, they can withdraw from any number of channels at once
6. As long as the state keeps advancing, publishers have a constant guarantee of their revenue; should the state stop advancing, publishers can immediately stop serving ads

The benefits of this approach are:

* The only on-chain transactions are a deposit operation (which creates a campaign and a channel, `channelOpen`) and a withdraw (allowing any party to withdraw earnings, `channelWithdraw`)
* Publishers have a constant guarantee that they can withdraw their latest earnings on-chain
* Since **OUTPACE** is one-to-many, a campaign can be executed by multiple publishers
* If new states are no longer created (someone is no longer offline or is malicious), publishers can immediately stop delivering ads for this campaign (channel)
* Allows off-chain negotiations: advertisers can bid for impressions in real time
* All data, other than payments, is kept off-chain





------------------------------

@TODO why validators are generalized, why can you need more than two

@TODO merkle proofs, unidirectional payment channels

@TODO benefits: continuous guarantee that you can withdraw your earnings, UX, bid selection, etc.

@TODO channel spec: the stateRoot contains lastEventHash; events should always be linked by containing a hash to the previous event, to ensure an immutable data structure; however, we should decide merkelize all events, in order to allow people ot check if events are genuine

@TODO impl adex-smart-platform: rust? simple API, on top of SQL (sqlite/postgres both supported) and tokio for networking (zap?); WASM state transition function
@TODO can adex-smart-platform be designed in a blockchain-agnostic way; the blockchain interface should allow to enumerate channels, sign a channel state update
@TODO describe the `adex-smart-platform` node implementation: performance is critical;  needs to easily scale horizontally and sharding needs to be thought of; needs merkle trees too, but the channel would merely be open with (deposit, timeout) and advanced with (stateRoot, signatures)

@TODO header bidding spec; On each open of a publisher website, it would pull all bids from the operator and select a bid (campaign), and send events

@TODO channel spec: the worst byzantine case if the validators do not allow the advertiser to close their campaign (exhaust the channel by paying the remainder to themselves)

@TODO channel spec: describe timeouts, and how they're really last resort; if you expect the channel to be exhausted in 1m, the timeout should be 3x that (3m)

@TODO adex-smart-platform: one more interesting spec thing to think about: pre-paying for impressions: the leader would sign a state update that PAYS first, and the impression will be shown after

@TODO describe at what point (how many unreported events) the smart platform (publisher/supply) would decide to untrust the channel; or at which point an individual publisher might stop trusting it (e.g. invalid balances tree); perhaps a % of the min impressions for a campaign
@TODO a nice privacy preserving property would be that the platform wouldn't reveal which wallet (in terms of revenue in the balances part of the state tree) belongs to which publisher; that way you can't see where the money from an advertising campaign is flowing, even if everyone withdrawls

@TODO: consider libp2p for communicating between payment channel participants
@TODO Mention the off chain complexity cost, in reaching consensus especially when one party missed an event
@TODO There should be a special msg in the payment channel that should be send to the consensus leader: `need_missed_events` or something like that - where the follower(s) say that they wonâ€™t continue signing unless those events are included or at least some part of them; that would be determined by `missed_event_threshold`

@TODO sidenote, the smart contract itself will be suspiciously simple so it has to be well documented

@TODO blog post about benefits, use cases of the unidirectional payment channel model with multiple validators; perhaps it can even be used in a DEX if we can atomically interleave a value transfer between two unidirectional payment channels; can be done with something similar to HTLC
@TODO questions that arise
"But what if someone goes offline?"
"but what if someone uses older state?"
"what if the parties mutually agree to close the channel early?" - explain how, on mutual agreement, the paying party can withdraw their funds out; the timeout only exists for extreme byzantine cases
"are 2 validators enough" - if the validators have opposing interests, yes; in this case, the model is exactly as in any payment channel - party A will send micropayments to party B, and if party A stops paying, party B can stop delivering their service and withdraw theire earnings without much loss (Use (1))
"what does leading validator imply?" - they only propose new states, but can't authorize spending without a total supermajority
"are there other usecases besides AdEx" - "a dex", pun intended, lol
"is this for ethereum?" technically it can be done on any programmable blockchain platform; it can even be done on BTC using the UTXO model, similarly to how lightning works; unfortunately we need RSMC

@TODO describe canceling a campaign (exhausting a channel) with a consensus, cancellation fee that goes to the publisher smart platform

@TODO BTC version; this will be pretty easy to do on top of UTXO's and scripts; when opening a channel, two tx-es are created with the same inputs (advertiser funds), one being a spendable by multisig of validators, the other being a timelocked tx spendable by the advertiser (returns funds to advertiser); to advance the channel, the validators sign new TX-es which contain the msig TX output as an input, and many outputs (the balances tree); to invalidate old tx, we can use a similar scheme as the LN (RSMC); since this is so similar to the LN, can it be built on top, and can it be compatible?
@TODO BTC: actually, we can do a slightly less trustless model which does not require RSMC; the advertiser signs the tx and gives it to the publisher; the publisher validator does not sign it (or just doesn't reveal); once the channel is exhausted, then they sign it and it can be broadcast; this is suboptimal since publishers don't have a constant revenue guarantee that they can verify; alternatively, the publisher validator could sign and reveal the sig to the publishers, but if one of them leaks it, that will allow the advertiser to broadcast it early
@TODO can the LN play in here? 

@TODO describe the possibility to reward users with tokens (via the balances tree); However the economic incentives work against us as they incentivize users to forge; although if the users masquerade as publishers, it should be the same thing; Anyway, memory-bound PoW and ip limits should be considered; and/or using the ip in the sig

@TODO describe importance of validators staying available

@TODO when describing OUTPACE, lean on ameen's "a way for two or more entities to privately make updates to some state that only they control"; OCEAN spec should include state transition fn as well; OUTPACE extension should include the balance tree and restrictions; also, when describing OCEAN/OUTPACE emphasize privacy

@TODO OUTPACE/OCEAN usecases: can they be used for interoperability? like LN

@TODO describe the bidding system: between the smart platform and the publisher/user; maybe send bid{matchToCpmRatio, minCpm}; then we calculate match rating (floating point, 0 to 1, depending on targeting) and the bid price is `max(matchToCpmRatio*match, minCpm)`; as for the match ratio, that can actually be defined as; every ad gets a match rating `sum(targetingTags.filter(tag in userTags).map(x => x.weight))`, and then all match ratings will be scaled between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the highest match rating;   ALTHOUGH this model is not nice for privacy - you can probe if a user has a certain tag at a cost of outbidding everyone else

@TODO bidding system: should we use a second-price auction? also, there should be a minimum threshold of difference in order for a bid to be considered higher (e.g. at least 0.5% higher)

@TODO describe `adex-smart-platform` events mempool: a sorted set, where `insert` and `find` work via a binary search, we pop items from the beginning (oldest first) to clean it up; describe messages between validators too: ProposeNewState, SignNewState, RequestEventsBeIncluded; consider a Heartbeat message; also, each node should keep an internal ledger of who else from the validator set is online - if 1/3 or more is offline, stop showing the ad (stop participating in bidding);  also we should keep from who we observed which event, so that we can see if the events we didn't see were observed by the supermajority; also think of IP guarantees here, since it's the only thing preventing events from being just re-broadcasted; ANOTHEr security measure is have the user sign the event for every validator separately

@TODO adex-smart-platform DB structure, including a table `channels_onchain` which is populated by the blockchain-specific adapter (which consists of a continuous process that populates the table, AND an interface to sign and provide merkle proofs); this is important for having an agnostic system

@TODO describe internal ledgers in adex-smart-platform: there's one on which events were provably observed by other users; and one for how many fees are claimed (ClaimValidationFee, can be created by a validator to make them claim a fee)

@TODO describe the bidding model; bidding is currenly not trustless, so describe the implications of this; we can make a mini state channel like thing where each next bid links a previous one by hash, but that's not censorship resistant; it's also very similar to a blind auction

@TODO adex-smart-platform: might need a restriction on the max publishers, or on min spend per publisher; since otherwise it might not be worth it for a publisher to withdraw

@TODO adex-smart-platform parameters: e.g. `{ batching: { maxEvents, maxTime } }`

@TODO you can do an affiliate network, by rewarding the publisher if someone bought something on the site of the advertiser; in other words, adex can be used as an affiliates platform

@TODO encrypt user's data in the SDK? with a key from the nodes?

@TODO homomorphic encryption or some kind of obfuscation of the data in the SDK? how can this be done?

@TODO validator fees can be paid via the OUTPACE channels themselves; the fees can even by dynamic/ongoing

@TODO describe the idea of users implicitly outbidding advertisers, if they want to pay for content rather than see ads; the flow of money is `{user OR advertiser} -> publisher`
