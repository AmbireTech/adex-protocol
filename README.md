# AdEx Protocol


## Intro

AdEx originated in 2017 as a decentralized ad exchange for digital advertising, and subsequently evolved into a full protocol for decentralized digital advertising.

The AdEx protocol facilitates trading of advertising space/time, as well as the subsequent verification and proof that it actually occured. Essentially, it covers all interactions between publishers, advertisers and end users.

The rationale for creating the AdEx Protocol was to create an open-source, transparent and fraud proof replacement to the entire existing adtech stack, therefore providing a better alternative to the existing situation in adtech. For more information on our rationale, see the [business case whitepaper](https://www.adex.network/adex/AdEx-Whitepaper-v.8.pdf).

The AdEx team also develops a dApp built on top of the Ethereum implementation of our protocol, hosted at https://beta.adex.network and available at https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-dapp
